</div>
<div id="tribute-info"><p> Paul Jobs was an American inventor, designer and entrepreneur who was the co-founder, chief executive and chairman of Apple Computer. Apple's revolutionary products, which include the iPod, iPhone and iPad, are now seen as dictating the evolution of modern technology. Born in 1955 to two University of Wisconsin graduate students who gave 
    him up for adoption, Jobs was smart but directionless, dropping out of 
    college and experimenting with different pursuits before co-founding 
    Apple with Steve Wozniak in 1976. Jobs left the company in 1985,
     launching Pixar Animation Studios, then returned to Apple more 
     than a decade later. Jobs died in 2011 following a long battle
      with pancreatic cancer. </p>
      <p>In 2011, Forbes estimated the majority of Steve Jobsâ€™ net worth at around $6.5 billion to $7 billion from
           his sale of Pixar to the Walt Disney Company in 2006.
            However if Jobs had not sold his Apple shares in 1985,
             when he left the company he founded for over a decade,
              his net worth would have been a staggering $36 billion.</p>
